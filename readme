this is my first git file, dont mess with it
#stage a file 
git add <filename>
#commit a file
git commit -m "message"
#to list status
git status

#this is the short cut

#to add remote origin 
git remote add origin https://github.com/Carmeganda/melacute.git

#to push committed files from local to origin
git push -u origin master

this is for my friends May 18
